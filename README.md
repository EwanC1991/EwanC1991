### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Software Developer based in Glasgow. I'm currently looking for roles in the Tech Industry. I'm just about to finish my studies for a Personal Development Award through the CodeClan Professional Software Development Course. 

### Projects

The user is also able to mark each destination as visited or unvisited as well as viewing a page of all visited and unvisited locations.
