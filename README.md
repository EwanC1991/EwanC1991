### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Software Developer based in Glasgow. I'm currently looking for roles in the Tech Industry. I'm just about to finish my studies for a Personal Development Award through the CodeClan Professional Software Development Course. 

### Projects

Sunnyside Travel App is a Travel Bucket List App. It allows a user to add Countries, Cities and Sights to an SQLite database. The user is also able to mark each destination as visited or unvisited as well as viewing a page of all visited and unvisited locations.

ENB Portfolio Finance is a Shares Tracker App. It allows a user to view the current prices of shares on the NASDAQ and compares the shares saved to the portfolio against the current price to show the profit/loss of each trade. You can also view a chart to check a shares performance over a long period of time.
